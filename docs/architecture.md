# BIM Bridge architecture contract

Last reviewed: 2026-08-15

This document is the canonical architecture contract for BIM Bridge. Read it
before changing source code, build logic, tests, Autodesk manifests, provider
routing, packaging, or installation behavior. If a change makes this document
inaccurate, update the document in the same change.

## Status and architecture decision

The product is **BIM Bridge**. Codex is not the owner of the Autodesk execution
system. The durable engine is an agent-independent **BIM Bridge Runtime**.
Codex, DeepSeek Harness, MCP clients, a CLI, and future Autodesk or third-party
agents are adapters over the same versioned **BIM Bridge Contract**.

Artifacts created by releases through `1.1.0-rc.3` use `AEC Codex`,
`aec-codex`, and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AEC Codex`. The `2.0.0-alpha.1` development
line introduces the `bim-bridge` Codex plugin, `bim-bridge-local` MCP
registration, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BIM Bridge` state, and BIM Bridge Autodesk
manifests. The installer treats the old paths as explicit migration inputs and
removes only known legacy-owned components. Version-1 `aec_*` MCP tool names
and legacy connector discovery remain compatibility identifiers until their
contracts can change independently. BIM Bridge 2.x host and Autodesk adapter
assemblies use `BimBridge.*` identities; `Aec.Codex.*` assemblies are accepted
only as explicit legacy migration inputs and are never emitted by a 2.x build.
New runtime configuration accepts `BIM_BRIDGE_*` environment names first and
the legacy `AEC_CODEX_*` names as fallbacks.

This is an evolutionary redesign, not a rewrite. The authenticated connector,
Revit shared adapter, runtime resolver, transaction implementation, structured
provider gateway, and unattended certification work remain valuable and move
behind clearer boundaries. Current source paths may remain in place while
ownership is extracted; logical boundaries must be established and tested
before large directory moves.

**Current implementation milestone:** package and locally validate the
agent-independent runtime behind the Codex adapter. The current scope installs
only the Codex adapter; DeepSeek Harness and other agent packages remain
deferred. Future agent packages may reuse the same read-only status, explicit
consent, host bootstrap, and restart lifecycle, but must not fork the runtime or
host binaries. This sequencing constraint does not make Codex the owner of
runtime behavior.

As of this review, unattended live acceptance has passed on the certification
machine for Revit 2024.1 on .NET Framework 4.8, Revit 2025.4 on .NET 8, Revit
2026.5 on .NET 10, and Revit 2027.2 on .NET 10. AutoCAD 2024 live acceptance has
also passed against the exact test adapter, including MCP routing, read, write,
rollback, clean shutdown, and descriptor cleanup. The machine-compared version
1 protocol/tool snapshot is frozen and broad runtime extraction has passed its
current compatibility tests.

The frozen version 1 compatibility fixture is
`protocol/v1/baseline.json`. It machine-compares the ten Codex MCP tool schemas
and annotations, supported MCP protocol versions, five connector routes, bearer
authentication shape, execute modes, and normalized request statuses. Contract
version 2 begins beside it at `protocol/v2/aec-contract.schema.json`; the v1
fixture remains authoritative for the current production facade until an
explicit compatibility decision updates it.

The current Phase 2 through Phase 5 implementation lives in
`runtime/aec_runtime`. It owns host discovery and authenticated request polling,
staged provider lifecycle and classification, the capability registry,
deterministic route plans, runtime-owned adapter sessions, signed request-bound
grants, direct contract-v2 host execution, read-back verification orchestration,
normalized results, and a redacted hash-chained execution journal. The Codex
STDIO MCP process is a version 1 projection over the same service.
`provider_gateway.py` is only a legacy import shim. The ten-tool MCP surface and
five connector routes remain the production compatibility facade.

The version 1 compatibility fixture was deliberately revised on 2026-08-14 to
classify arbitrary in-process query code as destructive/ambient-authority code
rather than as a read-only tool. Tool names and connector routes did not change.

Revit 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 and AutoCAD 2024 have passed their current
version-specific acceptance gates. On 2026-08-14 the user explicitly started
the packaging phase, lifting the release-installer freeze for this certified
scope. The new installer is a local development alpha and is not a published
release until its release archive, checksum, and cross-machine gates pass.

## Architectural invariants

1. **The BIM Bridge Runtime is agent-independent.** It must not import Codex,
   DeepSeek Harness, Claude, or another agent SDK. Agent-specific instructions,
   tool presentation, approval UI, and lifecycle hooks live only in adapters.
2. **The versioned BIM Bridge Contract is the center of the system.** MCP is the first
   public transport adapter, not the business-logic owner. A second adapter must
   not create a second request, result, error, capability, or policy model.
3. **The BIM Bridge Runtime never loads Autodesk assemblies.** Autodesk API assemblies
   are loaded only inside the exact matching Autodesk process.
4. **Host connectors are thin policy-enforcement points.** They own process
   registration, authentication, target-document checks, Autodesk UI-thread
   dispatch, native transaction/document locking, bounded compilation, and
   result collection. They do not perform agent reasoning or provider routing.
5. **Product behavior is shared by product, not copied by year.** Revit and
   AutoCAD each have a shared implementation. Per-release builds contain only
   exact SDK references, assembly identity, manifest metadata, runtime-family
   selection, and bounded compatibility shims.
6. **Runtime and API variants are explicit.** A release year is not assumed to
   identify one runtime for its servicing lifetime. The resolved installed API
   build is part of routing and certification evidence.
7. **Product/version support has one machine-readable source of truth.** Build,
   diagnostics, certification, packaging, and installation consume the same
   matrix; no adapter or installer maintains another year list.
8. **Capabilities and providers are separate concepts.** A capability describes
   what can be done; a provider describes one eligible execution mechanism.
   Provider availability never changes the meaning, risk, or result schema of a
   capability.
9. **Routing is deterministic and fail-closed.** A denial, invalid input,
   transaction failure, destructive-operation refusal, or possibly committed
   mutation is never retried through a different provider. Fallback is allowed
   only before execution when capability or provider availability is absent.
10. **Safety policy is independent of the calling agent.** The runtime owns
    immutable denies, risk classification, target scoping, and approval
    requirements. The active agent adapter owns the single user-facing approval
    experience, but a trusted runtime/broker authority signs the resulting
    request-bound grant. Adapters cannot authenticate themselves or mint grants.
    Host connectors do not add a second approval dialog.
11. **Verification is first-class evidence, not a prompt convention.** Results
    declare execution, transaction, change, verification, and rollback facts.
    Repair is a new explicit request; it is never a silent mutation retry.
12. **A successful compile is not certification.** Each exact Autodesk
    runtime/API build variant must pass load, routing, read, write, rollback,
    shutdown, dependency, policy, and cleanup tests before release packaging.
13. **The installer consumes certified decisions; it does not make them.** It
    discovers installed products, resolves them through the single version
    matrix, and deploys only matching entries already marked certified.

## Ownership model

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent adapter | tool/UI projection, agent lifecycle, approval presentation, contract translation | Autodesk calls, provider policy, transactions, business routing |
| Protocol adapter | MCP/CLI/HTTP framing and version negotiation | a parallel domain model or special-case behavior |
| BIM Bridge Runtime | host directory, capability registry, deterministic route plan, policy, provider supervision, verification orchestration, normalized errors, audit correlation | agent loops, model calls, Autodesk assemblies |
| Provider adapter | capability metadata and one execution mechanism | global policy or undisclosed fallback |
| Host bridge | authenticated local transport and request lifecycle | Autodesk APIs or product-specific transactions |
| Product host | UI-thread dispatch, exact document, native transactions/locks, API compatibility, dynamic compiler | agent SDKs, external MCP routing, approval UI |

`BimBridge.Host` currently combines the host bridge contract and transport.
That is acceptable during migration because its public types are neutral
host-protocol types and do not reference an agent SDK.

                        +------ exact Autodesk process
```

The first migration keeps the runtime embedded in the existing local STDIO MCP
process. A permanent background daemon is not required. If simultaneous Codex,
DeepSeek, and CLI clients later need shared provider processes or audit state, a
single-user loopback broker may host the same runtime interfaces; broker mode
must not introduce different routing or policy semantics.

## Versioned BIM Bridge Contract

The contract is defined as language-neutral schemas under `protocol/`. Version
1 connector endpoints remain supported while version 2 is introduced beside
them. Adapters translate transport messages to the same domain objects.

An execution request contains at least:

- a correlation ID and contract version;
- an exact host selector for mutations: application, resolved release/API
  variant, process/instance ID, and document identity;
- a stable capability ID and typed arguments;
- declared intent (`read` or `write`), timeout, cancellation, dry-run, and
  idempotency constraints;
- optional provider preference as a constrained hint, never a command to bypass
  routing policy;
- optional preconditions and postcondition/verification specification;
- a runtime-issued authenticated adapter session and, when required, a signed,
  non-replayable approval grant bound to the session, request hash, target,
  effect summary, issuer, and expiry.

An execution result contains at least:

- normalized status: `succeeded`, `succeeded_unverified`, `partial`, `failed`,
  `rejected`, `expired`, or `cancelled`;
- chosen capability/provider and exact host evidence;
- transaction/document-lock outcome and `rolledBack` evidence;
- normalized created, modified, and deleted identifiers when observable;
- verification strength, checks, issues, and evidence;
- warnings and structured errors with a stable code, stage, retryability, and
  provider-native diagnostic details kept in a bounded evidence field;
- timings and audit correlation IDs.

The caller does not select `native`, `mcp`, or `csharp` as an unrestricted mode.
It requests a capability. Dynamic code remains an explicit high-risk capability
(`revit.code.read`, `revit.code.write`, and AutoCAD equivalents), not an
invisible fallback for every failed operation.

## Capabilities, routing, and providers

The capability registry is data, not prompt prose. Every entry declares:

- stable capability ID, application, intent, input/output schemas, and risk;
- supported product/API variants and required host capabilities;
- candidate providers and their trust tier;
- targeting strength (exact instance/document or application-global);
- dry-run, idempotency, cancellation, transaction, rollback, and verification
  guarantees.

Every provider implements the same conceptual lifecycle: describe health and
capabilities, validate/plan without mutation, execute once, normalize evidence,
and optionally verify. It may be a deterministic host operation, an official or
approved structured MCP tool, or an explicit dynamic-code host capability.

`revit.view.capture` is a deterministic low-risk host capability. The shared
Revit product host exports one existing printable view with native
`ImageExportOptions`; it does not compile caller-supplied code or modify the
model. Output is constrained to BIM Bridge's current-user capture directory and
returns the exact file and view identity. The Codex v1 adapter projects this
built-in host operation through its existing provider discovery/schema/read-call
tools, and the connector carries it as a backward-compatible structured
operation on `/v1/execute`. No eleventh MCP tool or sixth connector route is
introduced.

The resolver first removes ineligible candidates by target, runtime/API variant,
health, trust, and policy. It then prefers the narrowest deterministic provider.
An agent may request an eligible provider for reproducibility, but policy has the
final decision. No routing step may hide a provider switch after mutation might
have started.

The resulting execution plan is a deterministic, inspectable route/effect plan,
not an LLM workflow planner. Decomposing a user's broad goal into multiple AEC
requests remains the calling agent's responsibility.

Third-party providers remain pinned child processes. This process boundary
isolates lifecycle and crashes but is not, by itself, an OS security sandbox.
Provider generations are parsed and validated before an atomic switch; replaced
processes drain in-flight requests before shutdown. Their tool names
and schemas are discovered at runtime. Provider-specific tools may be projected
for advanced clients, but they are not the stable BIM Bridge Contract. Arbitrary-code
or command tools from external providers remain blocked.

## Policy and approval

The runtime is the policy decision point; product hosts are enforcement points;
agent adapters are approval presenters. This preserves one human interaction
without making Codex or DeepSeek the owner of AEC safety.

Policy evaluates adapter identity, host/document target, capability risk,
effect estimate, provider trust, dry-run evidence, and configured access mode.
`Full Access` may satisfy configurable approval rules but never overrides
immutable denies, authentication, exact-target requirements, transaction
ownership, or unsafe-scope limits. Unknown third-party adapters default to the
most restrictive policy.

An approval response is scoped to one request or a narrowly defined batch and
cannot be reused for another document, capability, effect summary, or expired
session. Contract v2 accepts only sessions registered by the runtime and grants
signed by its approval authority. The signing key is never exposed to an agent
adapter and rotates when the embedded runtime restarts, invalidating old grants.
The version 1 Codex flow remains an explicitly weaker compatibility authority.

## Verification and repair

The runtime owns verification specifications and result normalization; the
provider or product host performs checks where the strongest guarantee exists.

- For a native host operation, required postconditions should run before a
  Revit `TransactionGroup` is assimilated or before an AutoCAD transaction is
  committed when the API permits it. A failed required check then rolls back
  atomically.
- For an external provider that cannot keep the native transaction open, the
  result must state `succeeded_unverified` or `partial` until independent
  read-back completes. It must never imply atomic rollback.
- Verification failure produces structured issues and repair eligibility. The
  agent may propose a repair, but execution requires a new policy evaluation
  and, when applicable, a new approval.
- Automatic retry is limited to proven non-mutating transport/availability
  failures and must preserve the same idempotency key.

## Execution journal

Runtime audit events are redacted before they enter an append-only, hash-chained
JSONL execution journal under the current user's BIM Bridge state directory.
The journal records requests, route and policy decisions, exact targets, state
transitions, provider identity, transaction/rollback facts, verification, and
normalized results. It does not record model reasoning or chain-of-thought.

The hash chain is tamper-evident evidence, not a signature against a malicious
same-user process. Read-only operations may be reconstructed from journal data.
A mutating replay is always a new execution request with fresh target validation,
policy evaluation, idempotency handling, and approval.

## Agent adapters

The Codex package is a thin adapter containing its skill, product metadata,
MCP launch configuration, and Codex-specific approval/tool annotations. Routing
rules currently written in the skill move into runtime registry and policy data;
the skill keeps only user guidance and adapter operation instructions.

Every agent adapter uses the same session-bootstrap lifecycle. On its first
activation in a relevant task, it runs the shared read-only host-status check.
When installation, repair, or upgrade is needed, it presents the exact version,
source, digest, locations, running-product constraints, and rollback behavior,
then invokes the shared host installer only after affirmative consent in that
task. The adapter performs only its own platform registration; it must not fork
the host installer, Autodesk payload, or installation state model. A skill can
be selected implicitly after a relevant user request, but does not imply a
background session-start hook on platforms that do not provide one.

DeepSeek Harness integration starts by mounting the same BIM Bridge MCP server, because
DeepSeek's tool registry already accepts MCP-discovered tools. A later native
plugin may expose an ergonomic `ctx.aec` service to other Harness plugins, but it
must be a client of the versioned BIM Bridge Contract and contain no copied runtime or
Autodesk logic. DeepSeek Harness is currently a developer preview with explicit
compatibility-breaking changes expected, so all Cordis imports and configuration
remain inside that adapter.

The project does not fork DeepSeek Harness, implement its agent loop, manage its
model/session history, or copy its permission system. The same non-goals apply to
Codex and future agent platforms.

## Target repository ownership

The end state is organized by responsibility, but extraction precedes movement:

```

The existing `plugins/aec-codex/mcp-server/aec_mcp_server.py` currently mixes
MCP framing, instance discovery, routing, provider supervision, and validation.
It is the extraction source for `runtime/aec_runtime`, not code to duplicate.
`provider_gateway.py` is now a compatibility import for runtime provider
infrastructure. The current MCP server is a thin projection over the unified
runtime service. Physical package/namespace renames wait for the packaging phase
and must preserve the version 1 compatibility fixtures.

## Explicitly rejected alternatives

- **Do not turn BIM Bridge into a DeepSeek-only plugin.** DeepSeek is an adapter
  over the BIM Bridge Contract and may be replaced without changing Autodesk hosts.
- **Do not keep Codex as the routing and safety core.** That would force every
  future agent to reproduce Codex prompt policy and make behavior diverge.
- **Do not create an always-on daemon before it is needed.** Extract a pure
  runtime behind the existing STDIO process first; introduce broker deployment
  only for measured multi-client requirements.
- **Do not expose one model tool for every provider tool.** Capability search
  and a bounded stable surface prevent schema growth; provider-specific schemas
  remain discoverable for advanced use.
- **Do not let an LLM freely choose a provider after failure.** The runtime
  resolves eligible routes before execution and prevents unsafe fallback.
- **Do not force one dynamic compiler across incompatible runtime families.**
  Keep the compiler seam stable and select implementations by tested runtime
  evidence.
- **Do not move every directory in the first implementation phase.** Contract
  tests and behavior-preserving extraction precede structural cleanup.

## Revit runtime matrix

| Revit release/API line | Target framework | Runtime family | Dynamic compiler | Add-in isolation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024 | `net48` | `netfx` | CodeDOM | unavailable |
| 2025 through the .NET 8 servicing line | `net8.0-windows` | `modern` | Roslyn | preferred when supported |
| 2025 after Autodesk's .NET 10 servicing migration | `net10.0-windows` | `modern` | Roslyn | preferred when supported |
| 2026 through 2026.4 | `net8.0-windows` | `modern` | Roslyn | required for BIM Bridge |
| 2026.5 and later | `net10.0-windows` | `modern` | Roslyn | required for BIM Bridge |
| 2027 | `net10.0-windows` | `modern` | Roslyn | required for BIM Bridge |
| 2028+ | declared after Autodesk publishes requirements | new or existing family | selected by family | required when available |

Revit 2024 requires .NET Framework 4.8. Revit 2025 and the original Revit 2026
line use .NET 8. Autodesk migrated serviced 2025/2026 product lines to .NET 10;
the installed Revit 2026.5 API on the certification machine already requires
`System.Runtime` 10. Revit 2027 also uses .NET 10. Build selection therefore
reads the installed `RevitAPI.runtimeconfig.json` for matrix entries whose
runtime can change during servicing, validates the detected target against the
entry's allowed targets, and records the resolved runtime in build and test
evidence. A future release or service update must never be assigned a runtime
by guessing from its year.

## Single version matrix

The repository contains one machine-readable MSBuild matrix at
`eng/Autodesk.Versions.props`. Each Revit entry owns at least:

- release year and support status;
- runtime family, runtime-resolution policy, default target framework, and
  allowed serviced target frameworks;
- expected installation/API reference location;
- adapter assembly and artifact names;
- add-in manifest behavior, including isolation;
- dynamic compiler implementation;
- structured-provider availability;
- certification state and required test suite.

The parameterized Revit project at
`src/BimBridge.Revit/BimBridge.Revit.csproj`, shared matrix
resolver `eng/RevitVersionMatrix.ps1`, adapter build, and live-test entry point
consume this matrix today. For a runtime-migrating release the resolver reads
the installed API's runtime metadata and emits artifacts under the resolved
target framework directory. The generic adapter is built through the matrix
script with an explicit version and is intentionally not added to the ordinary
solution build, which remains usable on machines without every Revit release.
Diagnostics, documentation tables, packaging, and the installer must
also derive version behavior from the matrix. They must not maintain parallel
hard-coded lists of years or assume that one release year always maps to one
runtime artifact.

The matrix is named for Autodesk rather than Revit deliberately. When AutoCAD
multi-version extraction begins, extend this same source with product-qualified
entries and shared fields; do not introduce an AutoCAD year list beside it. The
long-term support key is `(product, release, resolved API/runtime variant)`, not
just a four-digit year. Certification state attaches to that exact key. Build
scripts may expose product-specific views of the matrix, but those views are
derived and never independently edited.

## Shared Revit implementation

The shared Revit engine owns:

- application startup and shutdown;
- `ExternalEvent` creation and dispatch;
- connector instance registration and refresh;
- active document and selection reporting;
- read request execution;
- write transaction groups, commit, failure, and rollback semantics;
- capability reporting and audit results.

The parameterized version build owns only:

- the exact Revit API references;
- target framework and assembly identity;
- generated `.addin` metadata;
- a bounded compatibility implementation for real API differences.

All shared sources live under `src/BimBridge.Revit` and compile into the
`BimBridge.Revit` namespace and `BimBridge.Revit<year>.dll` assembly identity.
The same project is evaluated
once per requested matrix entry and emits a distinct assembly/output directory
for that Revit release. Avoid scattered
`REVIT2027`-style conditional compilation; put unavoidable differences in the
central compatibility boundary with tests.

`src/BimBridge.Revit2024` contains a project/manifest compatibility shim that
preserves the legacy installer and build input paths. The BIM Bridge installer
consumes the neutral matrix-built output instead. The shim imports the neutral
adapter properties and contains no Revit business source; remove it with the
legacy installer binding, never copy it for newer releases.

## Dynamic code compilation

The connector exposes separate read and write fallback tools whose C# method
bodies are compiled inside the selected Revit process.

- The .NET Framework runtime service uses CodeDOM.
- Modern .NET runtime services use Roslyn.
- The shared executor depends on a compiler interface and contains no runtime
  or year checks.
- Compiler dependencies must ship beside the matching adapter and must be
  included in dependency-isolation tests.

Compiler uniformity is not an architectural goal by itself. Revit 2024 keeps
CodeDOM for the certified baseline because it is native to the .NET Framework
runtime and has the smallest dependency surface. Roslyn targeting `net48` may
later be evaluated as an alternate runtime-family implementation for improved
diagnostics or analysis, but only behind `IRevitCodeCompiler` and only after
load/dependency/security tests. Upper layers must never distinguish CodeDOM
from Roslyn.

Generated code receives the documented Autodesk context variables and runs with
the Autodesk process and user's OS permissions. A `read` mode expresses query
intent and transaction behavior; it is not a security sandbox because code can
reach ambient host and OS APIs. All arbitrary dynamic code is therefore a
critical capability and requires approval. Low-risk reads must use structured,
precompiled capabilities.

## Add-in manifests and dependency isolation

Add-in manifests are generated from the version matrix and one template. A
manifest is not copied and edited by year.

Modern Revit adapters should run outside Revit's default assembly context when
the version supports it. Revit 2026 and later use the stable `BIM.Bridge`
context name and `<UseRevitContext>False</UseRevitContext>` so Roslyn, JSON, and other
private dependencies do not collide with Revit, Dynamo, or unrelated add-ins.

Current-user add-in locations remain version-specific:
`%APPDATA%\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\<year>`. All-user locations must be obtained
from the version matrix because Autodesk changed their security/location rules
in Revit 2027.

## Transactions and rollback

Every Revit write executes in one `TransactionGroup` and one bounded
`Transaction` unless an explicitly documented operation requires a different
native pattern. Generated code does not own these objects.

An exception or failed commit rolls back the request and returns
`rolledBack: true`. Success is reported only after commit and transaction-group
assimilation. A failed structured-provider mutation must not be retried through
dynamic code as a way around its safety boundary.

Connector-owned Revit transactions install one shared, non-interactive failure
preprocessor. Native warnings are captured in the execution result and removed
from Revit's modal failure pipeline; native errors are captured, force rollback,
and return a failed result with `rolledBack: true`. The product host must never
wait for an agent or user to click a Revit failure dialog, and it must not use UI
automation to dismiss one.

## Automated certification

Testing is layered:

1. Contract tests cover schema evolution, version negotiation, normalization,
   idempotency, and version 1 compatibility without an agent or Autodesk.
2. Runtime tests cover host selection, capability resolution, policy,
   deterministic routing, provider failure boundaries, verification, approval
   grant scope, audit correlation, timeouts, and cancellation.
3. Provider tests cover capability metadata, targeting, dry-run behavior,
   result normalization, and refusal to fall back after a rejected or possibly
   mutating call.
4. Matrix builds compile each host adapter against the exact installed Autodesk
   API. Compatibility tests exercise the bounded per-version API surface.
5. A separate development smoke-test driver launches the exact Revit executable
   and creates a disposable project without depending on a person at the UI.
6. Live acceptance verifies connector discovery, version/document routing,
   selection/read behavior, a representative write and read-back, intentional
   failure with complete rollback, clean document close, and connector cleanup
   on Revit shutdown.
7. Adapter contract tests prove Codex, MCP, CLI, and later DeepSeek projections
   create equivalent BIM Bridge requests and interpret equivalent results. End-to-
   end tests are additive; one agent's success never certifies another adapter.

The smoke-test driver may create a project from an installed template, save it
under a disposable test directory, then open and activate it. It must never use
a production model. Each run emits a machine-readable report containing the
Revit build, process ID, adapter version, document identity, checks performed,
and pass/fail evidence.

`eng/Run-RevitLiveAcceptance.ps1 -Version <year>` is the live certification
entry point. It uses one in-process bootstrap source compiled against the same
resolved matrix entry and one Autodesk-free external .NET driver. The bootstrap
activates only when its child Revit process receives a random request path,
validates a run ID and token, refuses an already active document, and permits
file creation only beneath
`artifacts/certification/revit/<year>/<run-id>`. The external driver probes
structured providers first, then performs all Revit interaction through the
version-independent MCP tools and an exact connector instance ID.

`eng/Run-AutoCADLiveAcceptance.ps1 -Version 2024` is the current AutoCAD
baseline entry point. With `-IsolateCurrentUserPlugins` it temporarily moves
only the installed current-user `BIM Bridge.bundle`, loads the exact signed test
adapter with a generated AutoCAD script, and restores the production bundle in
`finally`. Its external driver performs exact MCP routing, selection, read,
committed write/read-back, intentional rollback/read-back, cleanup, save to a
disposable certification DWG, clean process shutdown, and descriptor cleanup.
The driver archives an exact stale test descriptor if failure requires forced
process termination; it never attaches to an existing AutoCAD process or opens
a user drawing.

Every run writes `report.json` in its run directory. The driver verifies load,
exact version/process/document routing, selection, read, committed write and
read-back, intentional exception with `rolledBack: true`, rollback read-back,
runtime dependency location, test-element cleanup, clean Revit shutdown, and
connector descriptor cleanup. It never attaches a certification run to an
already running Revit process of the same exact release.

Live-test add-ins must have a valid trusted Authenticode signature before the
default entry point launches Revit. The driver does not click or suppress
Autodesk's publisher prompt; it fails fast with `untrusted_binary` evidence.
`-AllowUnsigned` exists only for an explicitly prepared development machine
whose Revit trust policy already permits those exact artifacts, and is not a
release or CI mode.

An installed production manifest that owns the same add-in ID blocks live
certification by default. On a dedicated certification machine,
`-TemporarilyDisableConflictingManifests` may move only the exact conflicting
manifest out of Revit's `*.addin` discovery pattern for the duration of the
run. The entry point must restore every moved manifest in `finally`, including
after build, launch, driver, or cleanup failure; it must never overwrite a path
that became occupied while the test was running.

`-IsolateCurrentUserAddins` extends the same reversible mechanism to every
pre-existing `*.addin` in the selected Revit year's current-user add-in
directory. Certification uses this mode when an unrelated or unsigned
current-user add-in could display a modal prompt or otherwise contaminate the
result. It does not alter all-user manifests, installed binaries, trust stores,
or Autodesk security settings, and follows the same no-overwrite restoration
rule.

`eng/Initialize-RevitLiveTestTrust.ps1` creates or reuses one self-signed
current-user development code-signing certificate, stores its non-exportable
private key only in `Cert:\CurrentUser\My`, and trusts the public certificate
only in the current user's Root and TrustedPublisher stores. Its non-secret
state is recorded below `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BIM Bridge\development-trust`. When that
state exists, the live-test entry point signs only the generated adapter and
bootstrap DLLs inside this repository after every build and verifies their
Authenticode status before deployment. This trust is development-only and
must never be reused as release signing or installed by the release installer.

## Migration sequence

The redesign proceeds through compatibility gates. A later phase does not begin
by deleting the previous working path.

### Phase 0: freeze and complete the baseline

**Status: complete.** The exact reports and frozen version 1 fixture are stored
in the repository artifacts and protocol tests; installer work remained frozen.

- preserve the passing Revit 2025, 2026, and 2027 reports;
- certify Revit 2024 and establish an AutoCAD 2024 unattended baseline;
- record the current MCP tool schemas and connector protocol fixtures;
- make no release-installer changes.

### Phase 1: introduce contract version 2 beside version 1

**Status: complete for the schema boundary.** Contract-v2 schemas, golden
examples, negative fixtures, and compatibility tests exist beside version 1.

- add schemas for targets, capabilities, requests, results, errors,
  verification, policy decisions, and approval grants;
- add golden compatibility and negative tests;
- keep current MCP tool names and connector `/v1` endpoints as a facade.

### Phase 2: extract the agent-free runtime

**Status: complete for the current production surface.** Host and provider
lifecycle behavior is owned by `runtime/aec_runtime`; legacy modules are import
facades only.

- move descriptor discovery, target selection, validation, and request polling
  out of `aec_mcp_server.py` into importable runtime modules;
- move provider lifecycle and classification out of `provider_gateway.py`;
- keep the MCP server as the only production adapter until behavior parity and
  existing MCP tests pass.

### Phase 3: make capabilities and providers explicit

**Status: complete for the current connector and structured-provider paths.**
The registry emits deterministic inspectable route plans, records targeting and
trust, honors only eligible provider preferences, and forbids fallback after an
execution attempt starts.

- add the registry and provider interface;
- encode current precedence, targeting limitations, and no-fallback rules as
  data and tests rather than skill prose;
- wrap connector operations, structured MCP tools, and dynamic code without
  changing their host implementation.

### Phase 4: add policy, verification, and correlated audit

**Status: embedded agent-free slice implemented; shared host path live-certified,
direct v2 adapter certification pending.** Exact write targets are revalidated by
the product host on its UI thread before execution. Runtime-issued sessions,
signed non-replayable grants, direct v2 execution, read-back verification,
normalized evidence, and a redacted hash-chained journal are implemented and
tested. On 2026-08-14 the same host execution path passed unattended live
acceptance through the version 1 Codex compatibility facade on Revit 2024.1,
2025.4, 2026.5, 2027.2, and AutoCAD 2024. This does not certify a future direct
version 2 agent adapter. The version 1 Codex facade continues to recognize Codex
as its weaker legacy approval authority.

- introduce deterministic risk/effect planning and request-bound approval
  challenges while retaining the version 1 Codex compatibility path;
- normalize transaction, change, rollback, and verification evidence;
- do not add autonomous repair or an LLM to the runtime.

### Phase 5: thin the Codex adapter

**Status: complete for the ten-tool facade, with the 2026-08-14 security
annotation revision.** The MCP process owns STDIO
framing, version negotiation, schemas, and argument validation; all host,
provider, routing, and policy behavior is delegated to `BimBridgeRuntime`.

- replace routing policy in the skill with runtime capability discovery;
- keep Codex-specific tool annotations, installation hooks, and approval
  presentation only;
- rerun all existing Codex-to-Revit and Codex-to-AutoCAD acceptance tests.

### Phase 6: add DeepSeek Harness compatibility

This phase is explicitly deferred and is outside the current Codex-only
implementation milestone. It begins only after the user changes that sequencing
decision and the version 2 contract plus Codex adapter are certified.

- first mount the certified BIM Bridge MCP adapter as a Harness MCP plugin;
- optionally add a small `ctx.aec` service wrapper only after the version 2
  contract is stable;
- pin the tested Harness version because its developer preview permits breaking
  changes, and test the adapter independently from the BIM Bridge Runtime.

### Phase 7: generalize AutoCAD versions

- convert AutoCAD 2024 into a shared AutoCAD host plus matrix-driven variants;
- reuse the same contract, runtime, capability, policy, and certification
  layers; do not reuse Revit transaction code or API compatibility shims.

### Phase 8: redesign packaging and installation

**Status: in progress for a Codex-only development alpha.** The lightweight
`bim-bridge` plugin and Skill bootstrap are separated from the transactional
Windows Host installer. The installer uses the Autodesk matrix, deploys the
four certified Revit variants and AutoCAD 2024 when present, records hashes,
refuses loaded Autodesk processes, migrates known legacy-owned components, and
rolls back files and MCP registrations on failure. Publishing a signed release
archive and adapting other agents remain separate future gates.

- package the certified runtime, selected agent adapters, providers, and exact
  host variants;
- retain one recoverable installation transaction and one aggregated restart;
- support Codex-only, DeepSeek-only, both, or runtime/CLI deployments without
  changing host binaries.

## Installer boundary

The packaging phase is active for the Codex-only development alpha. The Codex
plugin is deliberately lightweight: it ships the Skill, a read-only status
probe, and an approved bootstrap wrapper, but does not own or auto-start an MCP
server. The Windows Host installer separately deploys the agent-independent
runtime and matching certified Autodesk connectors, then registers the external
`bim-bridge-local` MCP. Later AutoCAD variants remain deferred. The installer
consumes certified artifacts and the version matrix; it does not decide
compatibility itself.

Install state hashes the launcher, MCP/runtime source, Autodesk adapters and
manifests, and the critical private-Python bootstrap binaries. It does not hash
every standard-library or optional package file on every Skill activation;
packaged-archive checksum verification protects the complete release payload,
while the bounded installed-file set keeps the per-task read-only status probe
responsive.

Its required behavior is:

- support a lightweight agent package that can bootstrap the shared native host
  after a read-only status check and explicit current-task approval; installing
  the agent package alone is not consent to modify Autodesk or host state;
- discover installed Autodesk versions;
- deploy only matching, certified artifacts;
- keep connector support separate from optional provider support;
- refuse unsafe replacement of assemblies loaded by a running Autodesk process;
- apply all selected versions as one recoverable installation transaction;
- restore every previous target if any version fails;
- record installed files and hashes per product/version;
- aggregate restart requirements so one final restart is sufficient.

For the legacy migration, known installer-owned paths and the
`aec-codex-local` registration may be removed inside the same rollback boundary.
Unknown data and development trust under the legacy state root are preserved.
The alpha does not install optional structured providers. An agent package must
not modify native state merely because a task started: bootstrap happens on the
first relevant Skill activation, and mutation still requires explicit consent
in that task.

After a successful install or repair, the installer may remove only stale
`staging-*` and `rollback-*` directories that resolve directly beneath the BIM
Bridge state root. It must never broaden that cleanup to the state root itself
or to unknown legacy directories.

## Adding a future Revit release

1. Verify Autodesk's runtime, SDK, API, add-in location, and isolation changes.
2. Add one version-matrix entry with support status `experimental`.
3. Build the parameterized adapter; its manifest is generated from the shared
   template.
4. Compile shared code against the exact new Revit API.
5. Add a compatibility shim only for observed API differences.
6. Run the complete unattended live acceptance suite for every supported
   runtime/API build variant that will be shipped.
7. Change status to `certified` only after evidence is recorded for the exact
   variant; never infer certification of a .NET 10 service update from a .NET 8
   result for the same release year.
8. Allow packaging and installation only for certified entries.

The normal case should require a matrix entry and certification, not a copied
codebase. Autodesk runtime or API breaks may require a new runtime service or a
small compatibility implementation, but must not leak version checks through
the shared engine.

## Architecture change rule

An implementation change requires an architecture update in the same change
when it alters any of the following:

- trust or process boundaries;
- supported product/version/runtime matrix;
- source ownership between shared and version-specific layers;
- connector protocol, capabilities, routing, or approval semantics;
- dynamic compilation or dependency loading;
- transaction and rollback guarantees;
- automated certification requirements;
- packaging, install, repair, upgrade, restart, or uninstall behavior.

Small implementation details that preserve these contracts do not require a
document edit, but reviewers must still verify the document before making the
change.
